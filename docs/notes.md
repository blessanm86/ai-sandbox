### Week 1

- Utilized chatgpt's project feature to create a workspace
- Started by explaining my goals of learning, topics to cover and an example use case
- Asked for its opinion and eventually came up with a learning plan broken into milestones and checklists
- Created a repo and asked chatgpt to generate an agent friendly learning plan file that I could feed as context for 
  coding assistants like codex or claude.
- Decided to give codex a try as I already use claude at work
