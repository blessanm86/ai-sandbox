### Week 1

- Utilized chatgpt's project feature to create a workspace
- Started by explaining my goals of learning, topics to cover and an example use case
- Asked for its opinion and eventually came up with a learning plan broken into milestones and checklists
- Created a repo and asked chatgpt to generate an agent friendly learning plan file that I could feed as context for
  coding assistants like codex or claude.
- Decided to give codex a try as I already use claude at work. Subscribed to ChatGPT Plus for it
- Decided to start with phi3 and later try mistral:7b as the models and use ollama to run the models
- Created glossary entries for the buzz words learned so far

### Week 2
- Going through model options. Tried phi3-mini
- Selected llama3-groq-tool-use:8b as it was recommmend by ChatGPT as a good option for tool calling
- Running with ollama
  ```
  ollama pull llama3-groq-tool-use:8b
  ollama run llama3-groq-tool-use:8b
  ```
